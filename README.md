This is a reading extension that is meant to provide the usual things I want when reading
in the browser.

## Capabilities

Currently, it only supports getting referenced bible texts, in Portuguese and English, but
only brings up the ARA Brazilian bible translation. Another WIP feature is highlighting tool
that will maintain the portions of texts highlighted across multiple sessions.
